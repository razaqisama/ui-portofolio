# About Project

This is my UI Portfolio, I created UI Components using React Js, Tailwindcss and Storybook.
I didn't prepare the UI design, I just randomly follow my feeling and instinct to create it.
You can see, UI Components I Already created from my [Storybook Demo](https://6313446df4adf0cf3ca45868-xkzdzrphht.chromatic.com/).

I am open for any critics or suggestion for about anything in this project. Feel free to reach me out.
